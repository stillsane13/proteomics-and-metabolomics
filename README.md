# Proteomics and Metabolomics Analysis

This repository contains a complete workflow for processing, cleaning, and analyzing proteomics and metabolomics datasets.  
The project is structured for use with Python and Jupyter, with clear folder organization and Git version control.

- `proteins.xlsx` — main protein identification table  
- `metadata.xlsx` — sample metadata  
- additional raw files as needed

More datasets and metadata descriptions will be added as the project evolves.
